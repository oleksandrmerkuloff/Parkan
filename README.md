# Parkan - antivirus instruments
## Project stopped!!!

The main goal for this project was to create an antivirus with AI integration for system monitoring and looking for a strange file patterns
In this public repo, u can find a basic and raw implementation of Parkan, here you can find:

- Database handlers with scripts for cleaning and uploading virus signatures to it
- Basic password manager
- Full scanner and scanner for a single folder
- Basic quarantine for strange files
- Gui for app(yeah... I know this is ugly but this is version for public repo)

And I'm repeating myself now project is stopped but maybe later it will be continued :)
